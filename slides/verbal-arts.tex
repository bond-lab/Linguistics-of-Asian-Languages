     \begin{frame}{Many come from stories}

     
  During the Spring and Autumn period, there was a farmer (\textchinese{农民} Nóngmín) who had a tree in his field. He would frequently rest under a tree after a long day of working.

One day, he was working in the field and saw a scared rabbit come running past him, crash into that tree, and die suddenly. The farmer was overjoyed! He had just gotten a free dinner without having to put in any work.

While eating rabbit stew that night, the farmer had a thought. “Why even bother farming, when I have a tree that rabbits just ran into?” The farmer really liked this thought and from that day forth, he abandoned his plow to simply sit by the tree and wait for another rabbit to run into it and die.

However, to the farmer’s surprise, no more rabbits crashed into the tree again ever again. Overtime, the farmer ended up with barren fields, impoverished, and the laughing stock of the village.

\begin{frame}{Comparison with the West}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item These are not so different from Western proverbs (IMHO)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Many of which come from classic works
      \\ Aesop's fables, the Bible, Homer, ...
    \item Using them correctly is a sign of erudition
    \end{itemize}
  \item Chéngyǔ often require a degree of interpretation, as their
    literal meaning may differ from the figurative message they
    convey. For example, the chéngyǔ \textchinese{画蛇添足} \zh{huà shé tiān zú},
    ``to draw legs on a snake'', means ``to add something
    superfluous'', warning against unnecessary embellishments.  But this is also true for the English expression ``like lipstick on a pig'' or an expression like ``sour grapes'', \ldots
  \item Because of their semi-fixed form (normally 4, sometimes 5 characters) they are more distinct from normal text.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 2

\frametitle{Types of Honorifics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Teinei-go} (polite): verbs marked with polite suffixes (e.g., -\textit{masu}).
    \item \textit{Sonkei-go} (honoring): respectful forms for the addressee.
    \item \textit{Kenjoo-go} (humbling): modest forms used for oneself or in-group.
    \item These categories reflect social dynamics and cultural values.
    \item Honorifics are essential in everyday Japanese.

    \item Disagreements are often discussed privately and at a later time.

    \item Avoids putting people in a position where they may lose face.
    \item My boss would ask me to do something by saying \jpn[It would be good if this is done]{kore-wo yaru to ii desu ne}.  In effect, he was conveying the message ``you do this''.

        \item Surprise: \jpn{Eeee?} (really?), \jpn{Honto desu ka?} (is that true?)
          \item Back-channel grunts: \jpn[neutral]{un, nnn}, \jpn[new information]{oo, hoh, ooun}, \jpn[agreement]{ee, ne, he}, \jpn[stalling]{aa, sa, ma}
          \end{itemize}
        \item It is polite to make some sounds when you are listening
