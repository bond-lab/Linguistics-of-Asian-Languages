<h2>Metaphor across Languages</h2>

<p> Please look at some examples of PERSON is ANIMAL metaphors for your language before next week.  You can work in pairs (or triples).

  <ul>
    <li> First choose one of the languages (or copy is you want to do a language)
    <li> For each metaphor in English see if it can be used in your
      language, with an appropriate translation
      <ul>
	<li>If it can, write the translation and mark it with Y
	  <br>I have given some possible translations, for those
	  languages I have lexicons for
	  <br>E.g., for Japanese 狐 'fox' can also mean a a shifty deceptive person so 'Y'
	<li>If not, mark it with N
	  <br>E.g., for Japanese 狐 'fox' can not mean attractive person so 'N'
	<li>If there is another metaphor with the same animal, please add it in a new row, with a definition of its meaning.
	  <br>E.g., for Japanese 犬 'dog' can mean 'snitch; informer; informant; spy' so add this and mark it 'Y' 
	<li>If there are other animal metaphors you know about, feel
 	free to add them at the end. For example, in Korean, 청개구리  <i>cheong-gaeguri</i> "green tree frog/disobedient person"  (<a href = 'https://www.koreanstudyjunkie.com/post/%EC%B2%AD%EA%B0%9C%EA%B5%AC%EB%A6%AC%EC%84%A4%ED%99%94-green-frogs-korean-fairytale-english-and-korean'>Explanation here</a>)
	  <br>In this case add definitions for the literal meaning and the metaphorical meaning.
      </ul>
      <li>We will then discuss the similarities and differences in class.
  </ul>
