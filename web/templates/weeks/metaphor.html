<h2>Metaphor across Languages</h2>

<p> Please look at some examples of PERSON is ANIMAL metaphors for your language.

  <br><a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-DzF1WtoDigSmRFe1PbrM7r-4x5ivolPr5TyXanePqw/edit?usp=sharing'>The data is here</a>

  <ul>
    <li> For each metaphor in English see if it can be used in your
      language, with an appropriate translation
      <ul>
	<li>If it can, write the translation and mark it with Y
	  <br>I have given some possible translations, for those
	  languages I have lexicons for
	<li>If not, mark it with N
	<li>If there is another metaphor with the same animal, please add it in a new row, with a definition of its meaning.
	<li>If there are other animal metaphors you know about, feel
 	free to add them at the end. For example, in Korean, 청개구리  <i>cheong-gaeguri</i> "green tree frog/disobedient person"  (<a href = 'https://www.koreanstudyjunkie.com/post/%EC%B2%AD%EA%B0%9C%EA%B5%AC%EB%A6%AC%EC%84%A4%ED%99%94-green-frogs-korean-fairytale-english-and-korean'>Explanation here</a>)
	  <br>In this case add definitions for the literal meaning and the metaphorical meaning.
      </ul>
      <li>We will then discuss the similarities and differences in class.
  </ul>
