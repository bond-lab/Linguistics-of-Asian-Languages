  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
<p>This lecture presents the origin and mechanisms of the spread of
languages in East and Southeast Asia. The aim is to illustrate how the
expansion of languages is driven by multiple factors: the physical
characteristics of the region and its weather;
agriculture — specifically, the domestication of crops and animals;
trade both by land and sea, as well as political and religious
contacts.
    
<p>Moreover, the lecture demonstrates that the interaction between
languages in this region is ancient, with evidence of this contact
visible in the spread of loanwords. These loanwords often pertain to
everyday matters, adding to the historical and archaeological
understanding of the past.
