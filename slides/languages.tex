\begin{frame}{The major language families of SEA}
  \begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Austronesian}: mainly in coastal regions of Vietnam, Burma and
western peninsular SEA.

\item \textbf{Austroasiatic} (Mon-Khmer branch -- Munda branch is only found
in South Asia): widely scattered throughout MSEA region and extending
into NE India (Khasian branch).

\item \textbf{Sino-Tibetan}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tibeto-Burman} Burma, NE India,
mountainous regions of Western and northern Thailand, Laos and northern
Vietnam.
\item \textbf{Sinitic}  predominantly China
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Tai-Kadai}: southern China, SEA, NE India.

\item \textbf{Hmong-Mien}: (a.k.a. Miao-Yao): mostly in southern China,
extending into SEA.
\item \textbf{Korean, Japanese and Ainu}: Korean Peninsular and Japan
\end{itemize}  
MSEA forms a linguistic area in which many languages share similar
features despite being geneDcally unrelated.

\begin{frame}{Human and linguistic diversity in MSEA}
\begin{itemize}

\item Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) is recognised for its high degree of
human diversity in comparison to the global average.

\item This refers to diversity in all measures of distinction among human groups, including social structure, material culture, and genetic markers.

\item The diversity of languages, however, has been regarded as relatively
low, although they number around 2000. Why?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Language Families}: Many languages in MSEA belong to a small number of language families (Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai, Sino-Tibetan, Hmong-Mien), leading to similarities that reduce the perception of diversity.
    \item \textbf{Contact and Convergence}: Long history of contact, trade, migration, and cultural exchange has led to linguistic convergence, creating similar features across unrelated languages.
    \item \textbf{Multilingualism and Language Shift}: High rates of multilingualism and the use of lingua francas (e.g., Thai, Vietnamese) often overshadow smaller languages, making linguistic diversity less visible.
    \item \textbf{Linguistic Classification}: Differences in how linguists classify languages and dialects can influence the perceived number of languages, sometimes reducing the apparent diversity.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Austroasiatic}
The Austroasiatic family (AA) forms two major 
branches: \textbf{Munda}, spoken only in India, and \textbf{Mon-Khmer}, constituting more than 120 languages spoken in an area
extending from Meghalaya state in NE India to Vietnam in the east, and
the Malay peninsula in the south.

AA languages are also spoken in China.

\begin{frame}{Austronesian}

Austronesian is the largest and most widespread family in the
world, with somewhere around 700 (maybe as many as 1,200) languages
altogether and 300 million native speakers. Aside from Southeast Asia,
Austronesian languages are found on numerous islands in the eastern and
central Paciﬁc Ocean all the way to Easter Island. There is also a western
outpost language (Malagasy), spoken on the island of Madagascar.

Major languages include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Malay (200 million speakers, about 40 million as a ﬁrst language)
  \\  Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) and Malaysian (Bahasa Melayu)
\item Javanese (75 million)
\item Sundanese (30 million)
\item Pilipino (Tagalog) (50 million, 17 million as a ﬁrst language).
\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mon-Khmer branch of Austroasiatic}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Aslian (mostly endangered), spoken in southern Thailand and Western
Malaysia.

\item Katuic-Bahnaric, spoken in Vietnam, Laos, NE Thailand and Cambodia.

\item Northern Mon-Khmer, which divides into Palaungic and Khumic, spoken in
Yunnan and adjacent areas of Burma, Northern Thailand, and NE Laos.

\item Vietic languages, spoken in Vietnam (including Vietnamese)

\item Monic, spoken by increasingly diminishing numbers of speakers in Burma
and Central Thailand.

\item Pearic, spoken by small groups in Western Cambodia and adjacent areas
of NE Thailand.

\item A Pakanic branch has recently been proposed for a group of languages
spoken in northern Vietnam, and in Guanxi and Yunnan, China.

\end{itemize}
  
There are many competing classifications of the Mon-Khmer branch in the
literature, none of which has received universal acceptance.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Major Mon-Khmer languages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Khmer (Cambodian, about 13 million speakers)
\item Vietnamese (nearly 70 million)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Tibeto-Burman}

Most of the roughly 300 Tibeto-Burman languages are found in the South Asian
region, but many of them straddle the buffer zone between South Asia and
Southeast Asia.

Overall, the Tibeto-Burman languages can be quite different from Sinitic
languages, with agglutinative morphology, verb final word order, and postpositions.

Major languages:

\begin{itemize}
\item Burmese (30 million speakers)
\item Tibetan (5 million)
\item Karen  (4 million combined: S'gaw is
the largest, at about 2 million)
\item Lolo (Yi) (3 million, spoken in China)
\item Bai (1 million, spoken in China).
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Sinitic Languages}

Sinitic languages are spoken by a huge number of people (over 1,000 million)
in mainland China, and Taiwan, and in Southeast Asia.
\begin{itemize}
\item Mandarin
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Northern
  \item Jiang-Huai/Southeastern (Jiangsu and Anhui)
  \item Southwest (Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, eastern Hunan, western Guangxi)
  \end{itemize}
\item Wu (Southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang)
\item Xiang (Hunan)
\item Yue (Guangdong, Guangxi, parts of Hainan)  Cantonese
\item Min (Fujian, Taiwan, parts of Hainan)  Hokkien
\item Gan (Jiangxi, north-eastern Guangdong)
\item Hakka (southern Jiangxi, north-eastern Guangdong, western Fujian, part
of Sichuan, Guangxi, and Taiwan)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Major Chinese Dialect Groups and Number of Speakers}

\begin{tabular}{lc}
\hline
\textbf{Dialect Group} & \textbf{Number of Speakers (millions)} \\ \hline

\begin{frame}
  According to Goddard (p55)
  \begin{quote}
    As mentioned earlier, in the Chinese tradition any variety other
than Mandarin is referred to as a ``dialect''. This practice reﬂects the cultural
and historical unity of China and the use of a common script, but it is con-
fusing because in linguistic usage the term dialect implies mutual intel-
ligibility. Linguists usually refer to the seven language groupings just
mentioned as ``Sinitic languages'', and that is what we will do in this book too;
but it is not entirely satisfactory, because some of these ``languages'' have
many mutually unintelligible varieties. For example, Min is reported to
have nine mutually unintelligible varieties in the Fujian province alone
(Li 1992). On strictly linguistic criteria there are probably hundreds of Sinitic
languages in China (which is not surprising, really, in view of the population
size).

  There is also a native  transliteration system for Standard Chinese and other Sinitic languages: \textbf{Bopomofo}. It is commonly used in Taiwan. It consists of 37 characters and five tone marks, which together can transcribe all possible sounds in Mandarin Chinese:  ㄓㄨㄥ ㄍㄨㄛˊ , ㄅㄟˇ ㄐㄧㄥ, ㄊㄞˊ ㄅㄟˇ , ㄇㄠˊ ㄗㄜˊ ㄉㄨㄥ,  ㄐㄧㄤˇ ㄐㄧㄝˋ ㄕˊ, ㄎㄨㄥˇ ㄗˇ

\begin{frame}{Sinospheric features}

Sino-Tibetan languages found in SEA are more likely to have features in
common with Sinitic languages -- e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item complex tone
\item classifiers
\item limited morphology
\item isolating word formation
\item pragmatically determined syntax
\item reliance on zero anaphora
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Indospheric features}


Sino-Tibetan languages found in South Asia are more likely to have
features in common with Indic languages, e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item simple tone systems or no lexical tone
\item morphologically complex stems
\item fusional or agglutinative word formation
\item breathy and retroflex consonants
\item pronominal cross-referencing on the verb
\item well-developed case-marking paradigms
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tai-Kadai}

The Tai-Kadai (onen simply Tai) family splits into three branches:
  \begin{itemize}
\item Northern

\item Central

\item South-western
\end{itemize}

Thai is a member of the South-western branch, members of which can be
found as far west as Assam in NE India.

The established spelling convention is that `Tai' (pronounced with an
unaspirated dental stop \emph{t}) is used for the family name, and
`Thai' (pronounced with an aspirated dental stop \emph{th}) is
normally used to refer to the national language of Thailand.

  \includegraphics[height=0.9\textheight]{pics/image27.png}
\end{center}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Historical origin of Tai-Kadai languages}


Tai-Kadai languages are descended from a parent language estimated to
have been spoken by a single group of people approximately fineen
hundred to two thousand years ago.

Most linguists think that the Tai homeland was somewhere near the
present-day Vietnam/China border. Tai speakers are believed to have migrated from this region to northern
Vietnam

  \begin{itemize}
\item Laos
\item Thailand
\item southern provinces of China

\item northern Burma
\item Assam in north-eastern India
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Major Tai-Kadai Languages}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Thai (60 million speakers)
    \\ could be several languages
  \item Lao (4 million)
  \end{itemize}

Over 50 other Tai-Kadai languages.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hmong-Mien}

  Thirty-ﬁve languages spoken mainly in southwestern
  China, with several spoken in adjacent parts of Southeast Asia.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Hmong (also known as Miao: 5 million speakers)
  \item Mien (also known as Man and as Yao: 2 million)
  \end{itemize}

Most work has been done on this family by Chinese scholars, and it is
relatively little known in the West.   It is mainly spoken in the hills.

\begin{frame}{Japanese, Korean, and Ainu}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Japanese (125 million speakers)
  \item Korean (70 million)
  \item Ainu (isolate, fewer than 300 speakers) 
  \end{itemize}

Japanese and Korean share very similar syntax (agglutinative, case marking, verb final, pre-modification) and both have borrowed much vocabulary from Chinese.

    \huge Mainland Southeast Asia as a Linguistic Area
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mainland Southeast Asia as a Linguistic Area}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Languages of different families often converge when in close contact.
        \item A "linguistic area" (\textit{Sprachbund}) is where unrelated languages share features.
        \item Mainland Southeast Asia is a linguistic area due to long mutual influence.
        \item Shared features span phonology, lexicon, and grammar.
        \item Example: Limited syllable structures and presence of lexical tone.
        \item Many features shared with non-mainland languages
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


% Slide 2
\begin{frame}{Shared Phonological Features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many languages have a limited range of syllable structures.
        \item Lexical tone is common across the region.
        \item Example: Tones in Vietnamese, Thai, and many Chinese dialects.
        \item Mon-Khmer languages often lack tones, with some exceptions.
        \item Phonological convergence results from prolonged contact.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Phonological Features: Examples}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Limited syllable structures}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Mandarin Chinese} primarily uses simple syllables like CV (Consonant-Vowel) and CVN (Consonant-Vowel-Nasal), e.g.,
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textit{mā} (mother)
                        \item \textit{màn} (slow)
                    \end{itemize}
                \item Complex consonant clusters are rare in these languages.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Lexical tone examples}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Mandarin Chinese} has four tones:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textit{mā} (mother) – high-level tone
                        \item \textit{má} (hemp) – rising tone
                        \item \textit{mǎ} (horse) – dipping tone
                        \item \textit{mà} (scold) – falling tone
                        \end{itemize}
                        \framebreak
                \item \textbf{Thai} has five tones:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textit{maa} (come) – mid tone
                        \item \textit{máa} (horse) – rising tone
                        \item \textit{màa} (dog) – low tone
                        \item \textit{mâa} (mother) – falling tone
                        \item \textit{măa} (new) – high tone
                    \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Vietnamese} has six tones, e.g.,
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textit{ma} (ghost) – level tone
                        \item \textit{má} (cheek) – high rising tone
                        \item \textit{mà} (but) – low falling tone
                        \item \textit{mả} (tomb) – falling-rising tone
                        \item \textit{mã} (horse) – glottalized rising tone
                        \item \textit{mạ} (young rice plant) – glottalized falling tone
                    \end{itemize}

% Slide 3
\begin{frame}{Shared Morphological Features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lack of inflectional morphology is widespread.
        \item Use of classifier constructions is a common feature.
        \item Example: Classifiers used when counting nouns in Thai and Mandarin.
        \item Morphological similarities facilitate language learning across groups.
        \item Reflects a mutual adaptation over time.

\begin{frame}{Classifiers in Thai and Mandarin}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mandarin Chinese} classifiers:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \zh{一只猫} (yī zhī māo) – "one (zhī) cat"
                \item \zh{三本书} (sān běn shū) – "three (běn) books"
                \item \zh{五辆车} (wǔ liàng chē) – "five (liàng) cars"
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Thai} classifiers:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \tha{เด็กหนึ่งคน} (dèk nùeng khon) – "one (khon) child"
                \item \tha{บ้านสองหลัง} (bâan sǎawng lǎng) – "two (lǎng) houses"
                \item \tha{เสื้อผ้าสามตัว} (sûea phâa sǎam tua) – "three (tua) shirts"
            \end{itemize}
        \item Classifiers are essential when quantifying nouns.

\begin{frame}{Areal Lexicon}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beyond shared words, languages share conceptual frameworks.
        \item Term "areal lexicon" coined by James Matisoff.
        \item Shared worldview and consensus on topics worth discussing.
        \item Example: Similar cultural vocabulary across unrelated languages.
        \item Reflects deep cultural and linguistic exchange.

\begin{frame}{The spread of tone in MSEA languages}
  

  Vietnamese developed its 6 tones under the influence of Chinese, as
  demonstrated by the French linguist Andre Haudricourt. Some
  Tibeto-Burman languages are currently in the process of developing
  tonal contrasts, particularly those of the Bodic branch. Others are
  losing them, e.g. the Bodo languages of Assam.

Features (and vocabulary) can move across language families!

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Summary I}
There are five major linguistic families found in Mainland SEA.

While there are a great number of languages spoken in the region, the
linguistic diversity is 
relatively low, probably due to centuries of language contact and human
population
movement.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Summary II}

MSEA languages are characterized by:

\begin{itemize}
\item isolating word formation\\
\item tone\\
\item absence of inflectional morphology\\
\item classifier systems\\
\item aspectual and mood systems rather than tense systems\\
\item sentence final particles\\
\item rampant zero anaphora\\
\item serial verb constructions
\item re-duplication
\end{itemize}

Although there are many exceptions
