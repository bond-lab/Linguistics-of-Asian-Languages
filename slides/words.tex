\section{Loans as a map of the past}

% Slide 1
\begin{frame}{Loans as Indicators of Cultural History}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Words in a language can be either indigenous or borrowed from other languages.
        \item Loanwords are linguistic echoes of cultural interactions between different societies.
        \item They provide clues about the relationships, trade, and influences between cultures.
        \item Some loanwords are completely assimilated, while others retain foreign features.
        \item Studying loanwords helps reconstruct the cultural and historical interactions of a society.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 2
\begin{frame}{Types of Loanwords}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Indigenized Loanwords:} Words adapted fully to the native language, e.g., \eng{gift}, \eng{root}.
        \item \textbf{Prestige Loanwords:} Borrowed from languages of higher social or political status, e.g., Latin, French.
        \item \textbf{Cultural Loanwords:} Words borrowed to describe new cultural or technological items, e.g., \eng{coffee}, \eng{sushi}.
        \item \textbf{Calques:} Literal translations of foreign expressions, such as \eng{skyscraper} (translated into other languages).
        \item Loanwords often reflect social change, technological advancement, or new cultural influences.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 3
\begin{frame}{A Short History of English Loanwords (Early Influence)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During the 9th-10th centuries, Old Norse settlers in Britain introduced many words.
        \item Words like \eng{take}, \eng{get}, and \eng{want} became part of everyday English vocabulary.
        \item The similarities between Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon led to seamless borrowing.
        \item These words often refer to basic actions and objects, such as \eng{die}, \eng{hit}, \eng{low}.
        \item Over time, they have become indigenized, and their foreign origins are mostly unrecognized today.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 4
\begin{frame}{Norman Conquest and French Influence}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1066: Norman Conquest brought extensive French influence on English.
        \item French became the language of the ruling class, while English was spoken by the common people.
        \item Many terms related to governance, law, and nobility were borrowed, e.g., \eng{crown, nation, judge}.
        \item Legal and military terms also entered English, such as \eng{court}, \eng{crime}, \eng{army}, and \eng{navy}.
        \item French influence remained strong for centuries, leading to a dual vocabulary for common vs. formal usage.  Famously \eng{cow} vs \eng{beef}, \eng{sheep} vs \eng{mutton}, \ldots
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 5
\begin{frame}{Latin and Greek Influence via French}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The introduction of the printing press in the late 1400s led to an influx of Latin and Greek terms.
        \item Many learned words were borrowed from French but originated in Latin or Greek.
        \item Examples include scholarly and scientific terms such as \eng{scientific}, \eng{describe}, and \eng{bonus}.
        \item Latin had been the common language of learning across Europe during the Middle Ages.
        \item Borrowed affixes, like \eng{ex-} (e.g., \eng{ex-wife}) and \eng{-able} (e.g., \eng{legible}), became productive in English.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 6
\begin{frame}{Influence of Global Expansion on English}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As Britain expanded globally, it acquired words from diverse languages and cultures.
        \item Examples: \eng{pony}, \eng{potato}, and \eng{tomato} from American Indian languages.
        \item \eng{Coffee} was borrowed from Arabic, passing through Turkish before entering English.
        \item Japanese terms like \eng{sushi} and \eng{tsunami} were adopted as global awareness increased.
        \item These loans often indicate exposure to new items, cuisines, and cultural practices.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 7
\begin{frame}{Phonological Impact of Loanwords}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loanwords can change the phonology of the borrowing language.
        \item The phoneme /v/ became independent in English due to French loans.
        \item In Old English, [v] was an allophone of /f/, e.g., \eng{leaf} vs. \eng{leaves}.
        \item French loans with /v/, such as \eng{veal}, created new phonemic contrasts.
        \item Loanwords can also introduce new phonological features or entire sounds.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 8
\begin{frame}{Malay: Historical Loanwords}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Malay is positioned at a crossroads between India and China, facilitating cultural exchange.
        \item The oldest loans are from the Indic influence, especially Sanskrit and Pali.
        \item Indic influence lasted from the 2nd century BC to the 9th century AD.
        \item Borrowed terms include \msa{rasa} (feel, taste), \msa{nama} (name), and \msa{guru} (teacher).
        \item Indic loans are thoroughly indigenized, and speakers may be unaware of their origins.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 9
\begin{frame}{Arabic Influence in Malay}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Arabic influence arrived with the spread of Islam in the 1400s.
        \item Many Arabic loans relate to religion, law, and social practices.
        \item Examples include \msa{fikir} (think), \msa{lihat} (see), and \msa{haram} (forbidden).
        \item The influence of Arabic remains strong in both Indonesian and Malaysian vocabulary.
        \item Arabic terms often retain distinct phonological features, such as fricatives
        \item Arabic terms often have distinctive spellling, like \msa{kh}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 10
\begin{frame}{Malay Loanwords from European Languages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item After the fall of Malacca in 1511, European influence intensified in the Malay world.
        \item Portuguese loans include \msa{gereja} (church), \msa{garpu} (fork), and \msa{almari} (cupboard).
        \item Dutch loans include \msa{senapang} (gun) and \msa{pelakat} (gum).
        \item Later, English words were borrowed during the British colonial period, e.g., \msa{tiket} (ticket), \msa{kamera} (camera).
        \item These loans reflect technological and cultural changes brought by European colonization.
        \item Indonesian borrows more from Dutch and Malay from English (their respective colonisers.
          \\ E.g., \msa{kantor} vs \msa{ofis} ``office'' or \msa{karcis} ($<$\eng{karrtjes} pl) vs \msa{tiket} ``tiket''
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 11

        \item Tamil loans include \msa{kedai} (shop), \msa{katil} (bed), and \msa{mangga} (mango).
        \item Chinese loans include \msa{teh} (tea) and \msa{mi} (noodles).
        \item These loans are often related to trade, food, and cultural exchanges.
        \item Many of these terms are fully integrated into the Malay lexicon.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 12
\begin{frame}{Mainland Southeast Asia: Indic and Native Vocabulary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mainland Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian civilization, especially Theravada Buddhism.
        \item Languages such as Burmese, Thai, Lao, and Khmer borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali (Indic).
        \item Indic loans often serve formal or literary purposes, distinguishing them from native terms.
        \item Examples:          \begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
            Indic & Native Thai & Gloss \\
            \eng{sı̌isà'} &  \eng{hǔa} & head \\

               \eng{sunák} & \eng{mǎa} & dog\\
          \end{tabular}
        \item Indic influence persists in the scripts and learned vocabulary
        \item New vocabulary is often made through calques
          \\ e.g. \eng{thoola².that¹} ``television [far.vision]''
        \item Borrowing from Europe is less common (although becoming so)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 13

        \item The use of loans in Japanese reflects a dynamic interplay of traditional and modern influences.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Building words --- Derivational Morphology}


% Slide 1
\begin{frame}{Word Structure: Derivational Morphology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Morphology refers to the study of word structure and formation.
        \item East and Southeast Asian languages generally lack inflection.
        \item Inflection changes a word's form based on grammatical context, e.g., tense or number.
        \item Derivation involves creating new words through affixation, compounding, or reduplication.
        \item Derivational morphology is more common than inflectional morphology in many Asian languages.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 2
\begin{frame}{Derivational Processes in English}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Derivation involves adding prefixes or suffixes to create new words.
        \item Examples of prefixes: \textit{un-} (e.g., \textit{unreliable}), \textit{re-} (e.g., \textit{rewritten}).
        \item Examples of suffixes: \textit{-able} (e.g., \textit{reliable}), \textit{-ness} (e.g., \textit{sadness}).
        \item Derivational affixes can be productive, meaning they can be applied to new words.
        \item Compounding (e.g., \textit{bookshop}, \textit{blackboard}) and reduplication (e.g., \textit{choo-choo}) are other derivational processes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 3
\begin{frame}{Compounding in East and Southeast Asian Languages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sinitic and mainland Southeast Asian languages rely heavily on compounding.
        \item Compounds often consist of two elements, forming nouns, adjectives, or verbs.
        \item Examples in Vietnamese: \textit{b>n ghT} (table-chair) meaning "furniture".
        \item Compounding is a productive process and forms many new words in these languages.
        \item Compounds can have meanings not entirely predictable from their components.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 4
\begin{frame}{Compounding in Mandarin Chinese}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mandarin Chinese compounding includes both lexicalized and productive forms.
        \item Some compounds are parallel, where neither element modifies the other, e.g., \textit{huā-mù} (flower-tree) meaning "vegetation".
        \item Metaphorical compounds are also common, e.g., \textit{gǒu-xióng} (dog-bear) meaning "bear".
        \item Compound verbs can express a combination of similar or related actions, e.g., \textit{tòng-kǔ} (painful-bitter) meaning "bitter and painful".
        \item Compounding is a key process in forming Mandarin nouns and verbs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 5
\begin{frame}{Productive Compounding in Mandarin}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item New compound nouns can be created easily using productive patterns.
        \item Semantic relationships in compounding include location, purpose, and material.
        \item Example: \textit{tái-de@ng} (table lamp) denotes a place where N2 is used.
        \item The flexibility of compounding allows for the formation of many complex terms.
        \item Compounding reflects the isolating nature of Mandarin, with minimal inflection.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 6
\begin{frame}{Compounding in Japanese}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Japanese compounding is the most productive method for creating new words.
        \item Compounds can involve native Japanese, Sino-Japanese (S-J), or Foreign elements.
        \item Examples: \textit{aki-sora} (autumn-sky) meaning "autumn sky", \textit{to-kei} (time-meter) meaning "clock".
        \item Verbal nouns and adjective-verb combinations are also common in Japanese.
        \item S-J compounds often relate to technical terms, e.g., \textit{syakai-gaku} (sociology).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 7
\begin{frame}{Compound Verbs in Japanese}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compound verbs can express the manner or aspect of an action.
        \item Example: \textit{naguri-korosu} (beat-kill) meaning "kill by beating".
        \item Compounds with aspectual modification include \textit{kaki-ageru} (write-up).
        \item Native and S-J compounds follow different element orders due to OV vs. VO patterns.
        \item Compounding in Japanese reflects a combination of native structure and Chinese influence.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 8
\begin{frame}{Extended Meanings in Japanese Compounds}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compounds can acquire extended meanings beyond their literal sense.
        \item Example: \textit{hito-goroshi} (person-kill) can mean both "killing a person" and "a killer".
        \item Compound meanings can shift from action to agent, instrument, or location.
        \item Example: \textit{ha-migaki} (tooth-polishing) meaning "toothpaste".
        \item Such extensions reflect cultural nuances and historical language use.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 9
\begin{frame}{Abbreviation and Blending in Japanese}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Abbreviation is a productive process in Japanese, reducing phrases to shorter forms.
        \item Examples: \textit{paasonaru konpyutaa} (personal computer) to \textit{paso-kon}.
        \item Abbreviation often targets lengthy compounds and adapts them to preferred syllable counts.
        \item Blending can create new words by merging elements from different words.
        \item Abbreviated words are common in media and everyday communication.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 10
\begin{frame}{Reduplication in East and Southeast Asian Languages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reduplication is more common in East and Southeast Asian languages than in English.
        \item Vietnamese uses reduplication to convey meanings like attenuation or intensification.
        \item Example: \textit{tr¨ng -tr@ng} meaning "be whitish".
        \item Thai and Indonesian also use reduplication for plurality, e.g., \textit{dèk-dèk} (children).
        \item Reduplication may involve partial repetition or phonological changes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 11
\begin{frame}{Rhyming and Chiming Reduplication}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Indonesian features rhyming and chiming reduplication, similar to \textit{lovey-dovey} in English.
        \item Rhyming reduplication emphasizes or intensifies meanings, e.g., \textit{kaya-raya} (rich).
        \item Chiming reduplication involves varying vowels, e.g., \textit{teki-teka} (riddle).
        \item These forms are often idiomatic and carry cultural or emotional connotations.
        \item Extensive reduplication is also common in Thai and Vietnamese, reflecting emphasis or variety.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 12
\begin{frame}{Derivational Affixation in Sinitic Languages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sinitic languages like Cantonese have some derivational affixes, though limited.
        \item Prefixes and suffixes can form nouns from other words, e.g., \textit{góng-faat} (speak-way).
        \item The suffix \textit{-fa} forms causative verbs, e.g., \textit{yihndoih-fa} (modernize).
        \item Hakka uses suffixes to indicate gender, derived from kin terms.
        \item Though affixation is not prominent, it still contributes to word formation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 13
\begin{frame}{Derivational Affixation in Mainland Southeast Asia}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Thai and Vietnamese use derivational affixes to form new words and modify meanings.
        \item Thai prefix \textit{kaan-} forms abstract nouns, e.g., \textit{kaan-lên} (playing).
        \item Vietnamese uses prefixes like \textit{ph¶n-} (counter, anti-), e.g., \textit{ph¶n-kh¸ng} (protest).
        \item Many affixes in Vietnamese are of Chinese origin and used in educated contexts.
        \item These affixes are more productive in formal registers, such as journalism and academia.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 14
\begin{frame}{Productive Derivation in Austronesian Languages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Austronesian languages like Malay have extensive derivational morphology.
        \item Malay uses prefixes, suffixes, and circumfixes to derive new words.
        \item Example: Prefix \textit{meN-} forms dynamic verbs, e.g., \textit{men-darat} (go ashore).
        \item Suffix \textit{-kan} derives transitive verbs, e.g., \textit{mem-bersih-kan} (to clean).
        \item Derivational morphology is highly productive and central to word formation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 15
\begin{frame}{Derivational Affixes in Korean and Japanese}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Korean and Japanese also use derivational affixes, including productive causative forms.
        \item Korean causative suffix \textit{-i} has several allomorphs, e.g., \textit{boi-} (to show).
        \item Japanese causative suffix \textit{-(sa)se} is also highly productive, e.g., \textit{misase-} (cause to look at).
        \item Irregular derivational affixes exist but are less productive.
        \item Derivational affixation contributes to verb formation and modified meanings in both languages.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 16
\begin{frame}{Summary: Derivational Morphology in East and Southeast Asia}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item East and Southeast Asian languages show diversity in derivational morphology.
        \item Compounding, reduplication, and affixation are used to create new words.
        \item Sinitic and mainland Southeast Asian languages tend to prefer compounding and reduplication.
        \item Austronesian languages exhibit extensive and productive affixation.
        \item Derivational morphology is a key feature in understanding how words are formed across different language families.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Meaning differences between languages}

% Slide 1
\begin{frame}{Meaning Differences Between Languages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every language has unique words for culturally specific items.
        \item These words may lack direct equivalents in other languages.
        \item Examples include \textit{sake} (Japanese rice alcohol) and \textit{omiai} (formal marriage meeting).
          \item  \textit{sake} then broadened to mean any alcohol (polysemous with Japanese alcohol) with  \textit{nihonshu} meaning just  \textit{sake}!  
        \item Cultural differences also affect words for emotions, values, and life ideals.
        \item Even seemingly basic items and actions can vary significantly between languages.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 2
\begin{frame}{Challenges in Describing Word Meanings}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Describing word meanings is a complex task.
        \item Definitions must use simpler, more understandable terms.
        \item Circular and obscure definitions lead to confusion and inaccuracy.
        \item Polysemy refers to a word having multiple interrelated meanings.
        \item Understanding polysemy is crucial for comparing meanings across languages.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 3
\begin{frame}{Different Patterns of Polysemy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Words can have different patterns of polysemy across languages.
        \item Russian \textit{nos} and Japanese \textit{hana} both mean "nose" and can also mean "beak" or "trunk."
        \item These words are polysemous, having multiple meanings that overlap with English \textit{nose}.
        \item English \textit{live} has two meanings: "to exist" and "to reside somewhere."
        \item In Malay, these meanings are split into two words: \textit{hidup} and \textit{tinggal}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 4
\begin{frame}{Indicators of Polysemy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different grammatical properties can indicate polysemy.
        \item English \textit{live} in "reside somewhere" requires a place expression.
        \item Malay \textit{buat} means both "do" and "make," depending on context.
        \item The presence of different constraints or arguments can reveal distinct meanings.
        \item Understanding polysemy helps clarify seemingly ambiguous language use.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 5
\begin{frame}{Existence and Possession: A Common Polysemy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many languages have a single word for "existence" and "have."
        \item Malay \textit{ada} and Mandarin \textit{yǒu} mean both "there is" and "have."
        \item The different meanings are distinguished by their grammatical frames.
        \item "There is" takes one argument; "have" takes two arguments.
        \item Example: Malay \textit{ada dua ekor lembu} (there are two cows) vs. \textit{Orang ini ada dua ekor lembu} (this person has two cows).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 6
\begin{frame}{Different Meanings for Basic Items}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some languages lack a word that exactly matches English "water."
        \item Japanese has \textit{mizu} for "non-hot water" and \textit{yu} for "hot water."
        \item \textit{Mizu} cannot be used for hot water, and combining \textit{atsui} ("hot") with \textit{mizu} sounds unnatural.
        \item This distinction is ignored in English, which uses "water" for both.
        \item Different lexical distinctions reflect cultural perceptions of basic items.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 7
